`
Also would like to request a feature for the curriculum page: that be added a progress bar regarding the full curriculum as well as the current track in progress. and better navigation

[#17964](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/issues/17964)  - similar (completed!) script. it adds left-side panel with info about completed challenges. [Forum topic](https://forum.freecodecamp.org/t/display-your-learning-progress-in-numbers/213065) for this.

[#18062](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/issues/18062) - feature request: show certification progress from within each challenge 

[pull#34331](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/pull/34331) - **actually it has already been done (partialy)**. I'd like to also have progressbar, not only numbers.

[#32960](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/issues/32960) - one more request to progress tracking

## What is left for me?

I still can implement progressbar. This I will do!
